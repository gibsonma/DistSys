Please find the complete source code in the ruby source code file P2P_Web_Search.rb.
The code contains the Node class which represents a node in the network and contains the majority of functions, including index, search etc.
The code also contains two threaded sections, one listens for messages and acts accordingly while the other awaits user input and acts accordingly to that.
From what I have done, I believe that all the functions required work, though there may be several bugs still present but I have not had enough time to test extensively due to exam pressure etc. Due in part to my architecture, a flaw is that sending pings and acks, or waiting to receieve them after sending a message is very messy and difficult to implement. Hence, I have chosen not to fully implement these features.
